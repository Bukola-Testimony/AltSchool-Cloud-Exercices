## Overview
LEARNING CLOUD ENGINEERING WITH ALTSCHOOL.

It has been exactly two weeks of learning cloud engineering with AltSchool and it has been the most exciting and tiring week for me.
This Project is a documentation of my progress in my chosen track.


### What I learned

This week I have learnt the different paths in cloud Engineering.
The history of and evolution of operating systems.
Evolution of Linux distros which is the most commonly used around the world.
I learned The difference between Physical hardware and virtual machines(VM) for which there is a need to set up a virtualization software.  
I also Learned several linux commands and still researching more.

It has been a loaded week of sleepless nights and a lot to learn, but the progress is well worth it.
