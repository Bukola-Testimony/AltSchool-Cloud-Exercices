## Overview
### LEARNING CLOUD ENGINEERING WITH ALTSCHOOL.
<p>
It's about 2 months of learning cloud engineering with AltSchool.There has been so many new concepts to learn. This is the last week in september.
</p> 
<p>This week we learnt about configuration management with Ansible.I must say that this is an interesting week for me. In simple terms, Ansible is an IT automation tool. It is primarily intended for IT professinals, who use it for application deployment, updates on workstation and servers, cloud provisioning, configuration management and many more.
Ansible uses a simple syntax written in YAML called playbook. 
</p>
<p>Terms used in Ansible includes: control node (where ansible is installed), Ansible playbook, Tasks, Inventory,Modules and Roles.
