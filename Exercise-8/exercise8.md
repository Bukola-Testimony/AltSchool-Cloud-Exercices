## Overview
#### LEARNING CLOUD ENGINEERING WITH ALTSCHOOL.
<p>
It has been exactly 6 weeks of learning cloud engineering with AltSchool.There has been so many new concepts to learn. This is the second in september.
</p> 
<p>This week we learnt Bash scripting. With Bash scripting comes conditional statements, iterations and Functions. File permissions needs to be set to executable to run an executable bash script. These files are started with a shebang line: !#/bin/bash. Bash scripting also allows for automation of scripts that runs within the linux environment.
</p>

<p>We also learnt about Crontab. This allows you to schedule commands or any application to run on the system. Cron job format : * * * * * which are minutes, hours, day, month, weekday respectively.
</p>
<br>
<br>


## Task EXERCISE 8ðŸ’»
-  Create a bash script to run at every hour, saving system memory (RAM) usage to a specified file and at midnight it sends the content of the file to a specified email address, then start over for the next day.
- The content of the file should be deleted and start a fresh log for each day.
- Submit the content of our script, cronjob and a sample of the email sent, all in the folder for the exercise.
