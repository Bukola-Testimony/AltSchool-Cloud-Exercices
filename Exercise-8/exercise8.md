## Overview
### LEARNING CLOUD ENGINEERING WITH ALTSCHOOL.
<p>
It has been exactly 7 weeks of learning cloud engineering with AltSchool.There has been so many new concepts to learn. This is the third in september.
</p> 
<p>This week we learnt Bash scripting.Bash is a unix shell and command language. A bash script is a series of command written in a file. These are read and executed by the bash program. It is used to automate repetitive tasks. 
With Bash scripting comes conditional statements, iterations,Functions,etc. File permissions needs to include (x) to run a bash script. These files should have an extention of sh. e.g (test.sh) The files are started with a shebang line: !#/bin/bash.
</p>

<p>We also learnt about Crontab. This is a (cron-table) file which contains the schedule of cron entries to be run and at specified times. Crontab files are usually located in the root directory. Cron job or cron schedule is a specific set of execution instruction specifying day, time and command to execute.</p> 
<p>Here is a cron job format : * * * * * </p>
<p>Each stars represents: minutes, hours, day, month and weekday respectively.</p>
<br>
<br>


## Task EXERCISE 8ðŸ’»
-  Create a bash script to run at every hour, saving system memory (RAM) usage to a specified file and at midnight it sends the content of the file to a specified email address, then start over for the next day.
- The content of the file should be deleted and start a fresh log for each day.
- Submit the content of our script, cronjob and a sample of the email sent, all in the folder for the exercise.

## My process
- I installed an smtp server and bsd-mailx package.
- created an Auth password from gmail. 
- I edited the ssmtp config file. 
- I edited the revaliases file.
- I pinged google,com and telnet smtp.gmail.com 587, 456 (to test both the google and gmail severs)
- I created a sript in the home/vagrant path 
- I created a crontab file and set the cronjobs to run the script and send emails at the specified time.
